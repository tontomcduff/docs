Hi Rick,

I'm looking for some generic Islamic banners to complete my 15mm army.

If possible I'd like;

Three of your square foot banners (including one in black)
Three of your longer flowing cavalry banners (any colours will do)

Also...

Two flowing gonfalon types for the Santiago Military Order
Three  foot banners for the Santiago MO

I'd be looking to pay by PayPal and my home address is:

20 Oakbank Crescent
Perth
PH1 1DD
UK

Many thanks.
